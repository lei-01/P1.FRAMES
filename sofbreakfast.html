<h2>?? Breakfast</h2>
<h3>1. Waffles</h3>
<p><b><i>Ingredients:</i></b> Flour, sugar, Baking powder, milk, butter, eggs, and Vanilla Extract.</p>

<p><b><i>Steps:</i></b>
<ol>
<li>Start by preheating your waffle iron, since the batter comes together in a flash. If your waffle iron has different settings to choose from, I recommend a darker or higher heat setting for crispy waffles. While the waffle maker heats up, add the all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt to a large bowl.</li>
<li>Whisk the dry ingredients together.</li>
<li>To a medium bowl, add the milk, eggs, and vanilla extract.</li>
<li>Pour in the melted butter and whisk the wet ingredients together.</li>
<li>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir just until combined. Your batter is done!</li>
<li>Grease the hot waffle iron with butter, vegetable oil, or cooking spray. Add about 1/3 cup of batter for each waffle to the waffle maker. Note that the amount of batter you need per waffle will depend on the size of your waffle maker! The waffle iron should be almost full of batter. But don’t fill it up completely because the batter expands as it cooks. Cook until golden brown. Place the waffles on a wire rack until ready to serve. Serve the waffle hot with maple syrup and butter or your favorite toppings.</li>

<p><b><i>Steps:</i></b></p>
<ol>
<li>Combine the pork belly, soy sauce, and garlic then marinade for at least 1 hour.</li>
<li>Heat the pot and put-in the marinated pork belly. Cook this all up for a few minutes.</li>

</ol>

<h2>DINNER</h2>
<h3>Creamy Beef Mushroom</h3>
<p><b><i>Ingredients:</i></b>Beef sirloin, Button mushrooms, Knorr Cream of Mushroom, Parsley, Garlic, Onion, Butter, and Cooking oil.</p>

<p><b><i>Steps:</i></b></p>
<ol>
<li>Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in a pan, then add cooking oil. Add your slices of garlic; we’ll need about a head of it, to really get that maximum nutty and delicious flavor. Sauté your garlic until it browns, then add your onions. Cook until they soften, then toss in your sirloin slices. Cook, while stirring, until you get a brown hue on the sides of your beef.</li>
<li>When your 35 minutes are up, add 8 ounces of button mushrooms and stir. Meanwhile, combine a cup of water and a pack of Knorr Cream of Mushroom in a bowl. Once you’ve incorporated the mix well into the water, you can now pour the mixture into the pan. Bring your dish to a boil, and, without the cover on, continue cooking for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
<li>For the last bit of this creamy beef with mushroom recipe, season your dish with salt and ground black pepper. Top it with parsley, take it off the stove </li>
