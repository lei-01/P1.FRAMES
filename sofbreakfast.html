<h3>1. Waffles</h3>
<p><b><i>Ingredients:</i></b> Flour, sugar, Baking powder, milk, butter, eggs, and Vanilla Extract.</p>

<p><b><i>Steps:</i></b>
<ol>
<li>Start by preheating your waffle iron, since the batter comes together in a flash. If your waffle iron has different settings to choose from, I recommend a darker or higher heat setting for crispy waffles. While the waffle maker heats up, add the all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt to a large bowl.</li>
<li>Whisk the dry ingredients together.</li>
<li>To a medium bowl, add the milk, eggs, and vanilla extract.</li>
<li>Pour in the melted butter and whisk the wet ingredients together.</li>
<li>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir just until combined. Your batter is done!</li>
<li>Grease the hot waffle iron with butter, vegetable oil, or cooking spray. Add about 1/3 cup of batter for each waffle to the waffle maker. Note that the amount of batter you need per waffle will depend on the size of your waffle maker! The waffle iron should be almost full of batter. But don’t fill it up completely because the batter expands as it cooks. Cook until golden brown. Place the waffles on a wire rack until ready to serve. Serve the waffle hot with maple syrup and butter or your favorite toppings.</li>
