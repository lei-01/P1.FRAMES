<h2>Dessert</h2>
<h3>Mozzarella and Mojos</h3>
<p><b><i>Ingredients:</i></b> Mozzarella cheese, Potatoes, All-purpose flour, Cornstarch, Bread Crumbs, Eggs, Salt, Pepper, Water, and Oil</p>

<p><b><i>Steps:</i></b>
<ol>
<li>Cut the mozzarella cheese into even stick-sized pieces and wash, peel, and slice the potatoes into thick rounds.</li>
<li>Boil the potato slices in lightly salted water until slightly tender, then drain and allow them to cool completely.</li>
<li>Prepare three bowls by placing flour in the first bowl, beaten eggs in the second bowl, and bread crumbs mixed with salt and pepper in the third bowl.</li>
<li>Coat each mozzarella stick in flour, dip it into the beaten eggs, and roll it in the bread crumbs, then repeat the egg and bread crumb coating once more for a thicker crust.</li>
<li>Place the coated mozzarella sticks in the freezer for at least 30 minutes to prevent the cheese from melting too quickly during frying.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, combine the remaining flour, cornstarch, salt, and pepper, then add enough water to form a smooth batter for the mojos.</li>
<li>Dip each cooled potato slice into the batter until fully coated.</li>
<li>Heat cooking oil in a deep pan over medium heat.</li>
<li>Fry the mozzarella sticks until golden brown, then remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
<li>Fry the battered potato slices until crispy and golden brown, then remove and drain excess oil.</li>
<li>Serve both mozzarella sticks and mojos hot with your preferred dipping sauces.</li>
