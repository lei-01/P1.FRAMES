<h2>DINNER</h2>
<h3>Creamy Beef Mushroom</h3>
<p><b><i>Ingredients:</i></b>Beef sirloin, Button mushrooms, Knorr Cream of Mushroom, Parsley, Garlic, Onion, Butter, and Cooking oil.</p>

<p><b><i>Steps:</i></b></p>
<ol>
<li>Melt 3 tablespoons of butter in a pan, then add cooking oil. Add your slices of garlic; we’ll need about a head of it, to really get that maximum nutty and delicious flavor. Sauté your garlic until it browns, then add your onions. Cook until they soften, then toss in your sirloin slices. Cook, while stirring, until you get a brown hue on the sides of your beef.</li>
<li>When your 35 minutes are up, add 8 ounces of button mushrooms and stir. Meanwhile, combine a cup of water and a pack of Knorr Cream of Mushroom in a bowl. Once you’ve incorporated the mix well into the water, you can now pour the mixture into the pan. Bring your dish to a boil, and, without the cover on, continue cooking for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
<li>For the last bit of this creamy beef with mushroom recipe, season your dish with salt and ground black pepper. Top it with parsley, take it off the stove </li>
